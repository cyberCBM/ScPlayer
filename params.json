It will work with versions 2.22 or later. To use the library it is necessary to first download JUCE to a location where your development environment can find it. Get the drowAudio(https://github.com/drowaudio/drowaudio) and put this module into Juce's modules directory.\r\n\r\nTo use the module simply include it, or a symbolic link to it, in your juce/modules folder. Simply them run the Introjucer as normal and tick the dRowAudio module. Config flags are provided to disable some functionality if not required (For ScPlayer you must disable curl module if your are reconfiguring using IntroJucer).\r\n\r\nJust put your downloaded directory parallel to the Juce directory. And you are ready to go now. You can change the part of code and build your own copy of ScPlayer(Server) and CsPlayer(Client).\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\nAll platforms supported by JUCE are will be also supported by ScPlayer. Currently these platform's Builds are avaialble.\r\n- Windows: \t\tApplications can be built using MS Visual Studio. The results are all fully compatible with Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.\r\n- Mac OS X: \tApplications can be built with with Xcode. \r\n- GNU/Linux: \tApplications can be built for any kernel 2.6 or later using GCC libraries. \r\n\r\n#ScTeam\r\n\r\nScTeam is SUM of LoKo(people) willingly developes ScPlayer.
